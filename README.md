# Raspberry-Pi3-Arduino-robot
The robot has a creeper apperance, RGB LEDs for both eyes and a camera as nose. The robot is capable of tracking green object.

//----------------Required parts---------------------//

1) A camera
2) 2 servos 
3) 2 RGB leds (optional)
4) Any arduino (Make sure to use 3.3v logic convverter to avoid 5V singnal to raspberry pi)
5) Some wires
6) Motors (optional, for future improvement)




//----------------Software and hardware info---------------------//

Two seperate code are written for this project.

The first code is written in python to run on the raspberry pi (.py).
The second code is written in arduino to run on the arduino (.ino).

before running the python script Open Cv2 must be installed on the raspberry pi.

A wiring diagram is provided to wire the servos on the arduino.
Images of the robot is provided in the folder "Images"
